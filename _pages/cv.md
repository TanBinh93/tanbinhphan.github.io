Education
======
* 2020: Ph.D. in Image Processing, University of Lorraine, France.
* 2017: Master in Applied Mathematics, University of Tours, France.
* 2016: Bachelor in Mathematics, Ho Chi Minh University of Science, Viet Nam.

Work experience
======
* 04/2024-Now: R&D engineer at Imagine Optic
* 01/2022-03/2024: Postdoctoral researcher at Laboratoire d'Optique Appliquee and at Imagine Optic company
  * Duties includes: This job is funded by CNRS to work in a collaborative R&D project between Laboratoire d'Optique Appliquee and Imagine-Optic company. My job in this project is to develop
algorithms for the processing of X-ray imaging and then a GUI software.

* 12/2020-12/2021: Postdoctoral researcher at University of Clinic Wuerzburg, Germany
  * Duties included: This work is a
collaborative project between University Clinic Wuerzburg, Germany and KU Leuven, Belgium.
The aim of this work is to estimate the motion of the myocardial through 3D echocardiography.

* 10/2017-11/2020: Doctoral researcher at University of Lorraine
  * Duties included: The main work focussed on the construction
of extended and textured 3D surfaces of the pyloric antrum region using only a sequence of
endoscopic images with a limited field of view.
