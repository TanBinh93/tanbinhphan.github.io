Education
======
* Ph.D. in Image Processing, University of Lorraine, France.
* Master in Applied Mathematics , University of Tours, France
* Bachelor in Mathematics , Ho Chi Minh University of Science, Viet Nam

Work experience
======
* 04/2024-Now: R&D engineer at Imagine Optic
* 01/2022-03/2024: Postdoctoral researcher at Laboratoire d'Optique Appliquee and at Imagine Optic company
  * Duties includes: This job is funded by CNRS to work in a collaborative R&D project between Laboratoire d'Optique Appliquee and Imagine-Optic company. My job in this project is to develop
algorithms for the processing of X-ray imaging and then a GUI software.
